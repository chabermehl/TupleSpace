Executalbe jar works as far as I know. The program is text based so the jar
doesnt do anything.

TextInterface.java is the main entry point.
TesterClass.java is used purely for hard coded testing. 

Tuple Space is fully functional. 

Bugs: When adding a user from the text interface, the user is printed off as a 
null value rather than the user name. Hard coded cases seem to work just fine. 

Missing Features: Go online/offline, send a message, recall all of the old messages
